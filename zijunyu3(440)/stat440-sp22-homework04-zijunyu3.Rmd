Grading Rubric (per question):  
2 points if complete and correct  
1 point if incomplete or incorrect  
0 points if no attempt made  


**Retrieving your work**

This and all future homework .Rmd files are written in Markdown. The .Rmd file can be rendered as an .html file for easier viewing. This and all future homework assignments are located in the **homework** directory within the **stat440-sp22-course-content** repo, i.e. **stat440-sp22-course-content/homework** in GitHub. It is always recommended that you **pull** (or refresh) the **stat440-sp22-course-content** repo to ensure that you have the most updated version of all course content including the homework assignments. After pulling (or refreshing) the **stat440-sp22-course-content** repo, the homework file will be in the homework directory. Once you have opened the .Rmd file, you may begin writing your answers beneath each problem. Do not remove any of the original problems from the file, because that makes it more difficult for the course staff to grade your assignment. 

**Submitting your work**

In your individual student repo (named as your netID), you are to submit ***two*** files:

a. Your reproducible document file (.Rmd) which should be saved as homework#-netID.Rmd. For example, my homework 01 file would be saved as homework01-kinson2.Rmd.

b. Your rendered reproducible document file (.html) which should be saved as homework#-netID.html. For example, my homework 01 file would be saved as homework01-kinson2.html.

**Do not place your files in a sub-directory (or folder).** You have an unlimited number of submissions, but only the latest proper submission (commit and push) will be viewed and graded. **Remember the .Rmd file needs to render properly to .html before submitting.** 


***

Undergraduates are expected to complete the problems **#1-#8**. Graduate students are expected to complete all problems.

**The following problems should be completed by you as an individual. If any problem asks you a particular question, be sure to answer it completely (with code, written sentences, or both). Written sentences should not appear in code chunks or code cells. Written sentences should appear in Markdown syntax unless specifically stated otherwise.**

***Do not change anything in this file above the double line. Doing so will prevent your homework from being graded.***

**#1** This problem includes concepts from the following notes/videos: Markdown.

**Problem:** Using Markdown syntax, make a numbered list with your netID in normal text as the first item and full name in normal text as the second item.

**Answer:**

1. zijunyu3
2. Zijun Yu

**#2** This problem includes concepts from the following notes/videos: Markdown.

**Problem:** Think about the previous two weeks (your experiences, assignments, and life). Using Markdown, describe in paragraph form (with at least 3 complete sentences): what was the most challenging part(s) about those weeks, and the thing(s) that made your weeks successful or unsuccessful.

**Answer:I haven't gotten used to SQL methods, so I need more time to memorize concepts and methods. Some of my friends actually dropped this course, so I sometimes can't find anyone to study with on this course. The office hours are very useful so I could have hints about the homework.** 

**#3** This problem includes concepts from the following notes/videos: Tool-making and programming Part01, Markdown.

**Problem:** If the statement below is TRUE, then write TRUE in the **Answer** section and provide evidence (code and results) that it is TRUE. If the statement below is FALSE, then write FALSE in the **Answer** section and provide evidence (code and results) that it is FALSE.

- Statement: R's `return()` function is always required for a user-defined function to operate.

**Answer:FALSE,return() is optional**   

```{r prob3}
# There is no return() in this function
exc <- function(n,rho){
  mat <- array(rho,dim=c(n,n))
  mat2 <- array(c(1:n,1:n),dim=c(n,2))
  mat[mat2] <- 1 
  mat
}
exc(5,0.5)
```

**#4** This problem includes concepts from the following notes/videos: Tool-making and programming Part01, Markdown.

**Problem:** If the statement below is TRUE, then write TRUE in the **Answer** section and provide evidence (code and results) that it is TRUE. If the statement below is FALSE, then write FALSE in the **Answer** section and provide evidence (code and results) that it is FALSE.

- Statement: Arguments in a user-defined function in R are not required to be named.

**Answer:TRUE,arguments that may be named or unnamed; think of arguments as inputs**   

```{r prob4}

```

**#5** This problem includes concepts from the following notes/videos: Accessing and importing data, SQL for weeks 03-07 content, SQL sub-queries.

**Problem:** After importing the Champaign County Sheriff Office & Jail Data using its data URL https://uofi.box.com/shared/static/b6kuknulot4bqyo7elc8gmm6qzhnk766.dat, use any SQL-specific cleaning data approaches to correct the misspelled cities: Champaign and Urbana. Your resulting evidence should be written in the **Answer** section below and appear as a table or tibble containing the counts of these two cities (corrected spellings).

- Data description for Champaign County Sheriff Office & Jail Data: The dataset contains 11082 observations and 40 columns for individuals who were booked into jail in Champaign County Jail in the year 2019. The individuals are identifiable based on personal identity, and they are given unique jacket numbers. Some rows in the data appear more than once because of multiple crimes being assigned to one person. But there is also the possibility of there being recidivists. A recidivist is a person who goes to jail repeatedly (more than one datetime). The demographics of the people, reasons for being booked, and crime code are also given in the data. The original source is the Champaign County Sheriff Office & Jail (CCSO).

**Answer:**

**#8** This problem includes concepts from the following notes/videos: SQL for weeks 03-07 content, SQL sub-queries.

**Problem:** Import the 2020 NBA Season Data (four datasets total) using these four URLs https://uofi.box.com/shared/static/grgt4wkiumfjgpug3fsx2vfkipv5rxz1.json, https://uofi.box.com/shared/static/af959qr9ewjgain1obkzmagapkmw8wbj.json, https://uofi.box.com/shared/static/raqot999l9yo6qz26k13epitft9j2ay4.json, https://uofi.box.com/shared/static/gcyl1gya0qkoceg0vpydd26mpwczrs56.json, and address the following (in this order) using at least two SQL subqueries and SQL-specific data management concepts:

  - combine the four data sets into a new object called "nba2020"

  - summarize the data such that all basketball statistics are totaled across all stints per player; there should only be 540 players after summarizing; use the final stint's Position, Age, and Team for each player

  - mutate a new column called "REBOUNDS" that represents a combination of offensive rebounds and defensive rebounds

  - mutate a new column called "ATO" that represents the assists to turnovers ratio (assists divided by turnovers)

  - mutate a new column called "PTM" that represents the points to minutes played ratio (points divided by minutes played)

  - mutate a new column called "3PP" that represents three-point shots made out of three-point attempts multiplied by 100

  - de-select the stint column

- Now, print the first 15 observations of the resulting "nba2020" data object such that the data is sorted by PTM in descending order and only the following columns are selected: PlayerName, PlayerID, Pos, Tm, Age, PTM.

- Data description for the 4 NBA 2020 Season datasets: The dataset (four .json files) contains a total of 540 unique observations and 26 columns. The observations are professional basketball players in the National Basketball Association (NBA) and their season statistics for the 2020-2021 season. A stint is the duration of time someone worked for a particular employer. In this basketball data, a stint is a number representing the time a player was with a particular team. Some players are traded during the season, which means they would have more than 1 stint. A player's basketball statistics start over for each stint they have in a season. There are 540 unique player IDs across all stints. The original source is the NBA and Sports Reference. Also see the [2020 NBA Data Key](https://uofi.box.com/shared/static/oe2bbjn0xyhs9azbxaz00ab5ua6nbr9r.pdf).
